useInteractionHook (Document 1)
Purpose: Handles all mouse/touch interactions and input events on the canvas
Key Functions:

setupInteractions - Mouse-based drawing and object creation:

Creates sticky notes and text objects on click
Handles pen/drawing mode with brush settings
Draws shapes (squares, circles) with click-and-drag
Double-click editing for sticky notes and text objects


setupKeyboardHandlers - Keyboard shortcuts:

Undo: Ctrl/Cmd + Z
Redo: Ctrl/Cmd + Y (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z)
Copy: Ctrl/Cmd + C (clones object to memory)
Paste: Ctrl/Cmd + V (pastes with offset, preserves sticky note properties)
Delete: Delete/Backspace key


setupPanAndZoom - Canvas navigation:

Mouse wheel zoom (with Ctrl for trackpad pinch)
Alt/Ctrl + drag to pan
Shift + mouse

RetryJPseems like there are repeatitionsEditYes, there are redundancies:
Duplicate functionality:

Copy/paste exists in both hooks (keyboard shortcuts AND canvas actions)
Undo/redo in both (keyboard handlers AND canvas operations)
Delete in both (keyboard shortcut AND handleDelete function)
Selection tracking duplicated (setupCanvasEvents AND updateSelectedObjects)

Overlapping responsibilities:

Both hooks handle canvas state changes
Both manage tool switching logic
Both deal with object selection
