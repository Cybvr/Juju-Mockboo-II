INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
LISA (30s, busy professional) stands in her kitchen with meal prep containers on the counter. Phone propped against a fruit bowl.
LISA
(relieved, conversational)
So I'm gonna be real with you. I hate cooking after work. Like, I get home exhausted and the last thing I want to do is spend an hour in the kitchen.
She gestures to the containers.
LISA (CONT'D)
FreshPlate has literally saved me. Everything's pre-portioned, healthy, and actually tastes good.
She opens a container, showing the food.
LISA (CONT'D)
Tonight I'm having this teriyaki chicken bowl. Takes five minutes to heat up. FreshPlate is the way.

Okay so Buddy has been obsessed with these TailWaggers treats I found. Look at him!
The dog's tail is wagging intensely, staring at the treat bag.
EMMA (CONT'D)
They're all natural, no weird ingredients, and he literally does tricks I didn't even know he knew just to get one.
She gives the dog a treat. He chomps happily.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Also they don't smell disgusting like other treats. Win-win. Get TailWaggers, link in my bio!
